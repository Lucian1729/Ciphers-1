Hello there!

This is a menu driven program in C++ that contains multipe ciphers.

What is a cipher?
In cryptography, a cipher is an algorithm for performing encryption or decryptionâ€”a series of well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure. What this means is that a cipher is essentially a way to encode normal text, so there needs to be a proccess to accomplish this - the algorithm. Each cipher follows a different algorithm and will be explained as required.

What is a menu driven program? 
When you run the code, a list of options are displayed and the user can chose what they want to do.

How to run the program?
1. Clone the program - First, open command prompt(cmd) and traverse to the directiory where you want save the file. now type ```git clone https://github.com/preethika-ajay/Cryptography```
2. Open and run
