    Encryption is the process of encoding a message or information in such a way that only 
authorized parties can access it and those who are not authorized cannot. Encryption 
does not itself prevent interference, but denies the intelligible content to a would-be 
interceptor. In an encryption scheme, the intended information or message, referred to as
plaintext, is encrypted using an encryption algorithm a cipher,  generating ciphertext 
that can be read only if decrypted.
